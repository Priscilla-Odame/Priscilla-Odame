### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 


<!--**Priscilla-Odame/Priscilla-Odame** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile. -->

So I like to watch animes, play video games, and I got into software development. Now I love to play games and code! ðŸ˜„

ðŸ”­ My current tech stacks are Node.js, TypeScript, and Python. I dabble in a bit of C++ and Java, but just for coursework.
 Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on lots of projects. <br>
 Fun fact âš¡: I read a lot of novels,mostly ones sci-fi and fantasy, as you may have already guessed ðŸ˜„!!

Cheers!!
